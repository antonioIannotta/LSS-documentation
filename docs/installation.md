# Installation

## Frontend
Installing the application on an Android device can be done in more than one way. The first option is to download the apk file directly from the [Releases section](https://github.com/GZaccaroni/smart-parking-frontend/releases/latest) of the project's GitHub page. Once the apk file has been downloaded, it can be installed on the device by following the standard installation process.

Alternatively, the application can also be installed using [Firebase App Distribution](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution). To do this, permission must be requested at [this web page](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/6533aa08a46f931c). Once permission has been granted, the application can be installed on the device using the Firebase App Distribution website. This approach offers the added benefit of being able to easily update the application.
